# Test

This repository contains a small React project demonstrating a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface. The app lets you add items, edit their text and remove them from the list.

## Getting started

Install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
